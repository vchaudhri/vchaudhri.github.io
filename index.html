<h3>About</h3>

<p>

  I am passionate about Artificial Intelligence, knowledge engineering
  and their application to a variety of domains including finance,
  education and law. My journey on this path is characterized by
  leadership roles, groundbreaking research and successful
  implementation of innovative technologies. <br><br>

  I am currently the principal scientist at Knowledge Systems Research
  LLC.  The primary activity is to support an NSF initiative on
  knowledge axiomatization.  The goal is to formulate a research
  program in knowledge representation and reasoning that best
  complements deep learning and generative AI, and advances the
  state-of-the-art. <br><br>

In my prior role at JPMorgan Chase, my team leveraged large language
models for a banker note classification task with a potential to
increase the business by $500M. I undertook a careful technical
comparison of graph database systems to help inform firm's graph
database strategy. <br><br>

At Stanford University, I helped launch a highly successful initiative
to bring logic education to high schools across America, undertook
education research necessary to for an intelligent textbook product,
and contributed to formation of computational contracts initiative. <br><br>

  At SRI International, I formed and led a team that undertook
  groundbreaking work in knowledge engineering creating the largest
  axiomatization for a biology book that was incorporated into an
  intelligent textbook. I also led the development of an ontology and
  query manager for an intelligent assistant that was the precursor to
  the Siri spinoff. <br><br>
