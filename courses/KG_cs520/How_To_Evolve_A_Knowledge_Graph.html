<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>Once a knowledge graph has been built, it will need to evolve
  in response to changes in the real-world, and changes in the
  business requirements. Such changes can be either at the schema
  level or at the level of individual facts in the knowledge
  graph. Updating a knowledge graph at the level of individual facts
  is usually much easier than updating the schema.  This is because
  some changes to schema can have far reaching consequences in the
  data that is already stored, and sometimes, even in the software
  that makes assumptions about the schema.</p>

<p>Approaches to handle the evolution of a knowledge graph must
address both social and technical challenges.  Social challenges need
to be addressed for, at least, two reasons. First, design changes
inherently have an element of subjectivity, and must have a buy in
from the users. Second, as the changes can have impact on the work of
multiple stakeholders, suitable workflow processes need to be in place
for any change to be rolled out across the user
community. Unfortunately, there are not many standards and best
  practices for how best to handle such social processes. </p>

<p>The technical
problems involved in evolving a knowledge graph have been fundamental
to database and knowledge base management, and have been researched
under the topics of schema evolution, view maintenance, and truth
maintenance.  Each of these techniques is meant for a different
category of updates, and is backed by significant theory that can be
adapted for the context of knowledge graphs.</p>

<p>The choice of different techniques for evolving a knowledge graph
  is also strongly influenced by the business requirements and the
  cost of making a change.  Most large-scale knoweldge graphs have
  numerous inconsistencies that persist over a period of time, and may
  be left unaddressed, simply because they do not affect a 
  functionality that is critical for business.</p>

<p>We will begin this chapter by considering several concrete examples
  of changes that are required in knowledge graph. We will then
  briefly introduce schema evolution, view maintenance, and truth
  maintenance. Our goal is not to provide a comprehensive coverage on
  each of these three topics, but to suggest how these methods are
  relevant to knowledge graphs, and should be adapted.</p>

<h3>2. Examples of Changes to a Knowledge Graph</h3>

<p>We will consider examples of the following categories of changes to
  the knowledge graph: changing world, changing requirements, changing
  sources, changes affecting previous inferences, and changes
  requiring redesign. We recognize that there may be more than one way
  to classify the examples considered here, but we hope that this
  categorization introduces some structure to the series of examples
  considered below.</p>

<p>Consider the Amazon product knowledge graph and how it must respond
  to the changes in the real world. This knowledge graph is
  constructed by combining information provided by multiple vendors.
  The product quantities need to be kept up to date with their sales,
  and as new shipments arrive. Suppliers are constantly providing new
  products, and some of them may require introducing new properties in
  the knowledge graph. Some products or product lines may be dropped,
  and may no longer be necessary.</p>

<p>As an example of changing requirements, consider the concept
of <i>Artist</i> in Google knowledge graph. The original knowledge
graph assumed that an <i>Artist</i> can only be
a <i>Person</i>. Significant checks had been put in the code to ensure
that the incoming data satisfied this constraint. But, over a period
of time, they started to see data that contained a <i>Vocaloid</i> as
an artist.  As a <i>Vocaloid</i> is not a <i>Person</i>, and there
were a large number of users who cared about listing it as
an <i>Artist</i>, this assumption needed to be changed.</p>

<p>As an example of the changing sources, consider the problem of creating
  a knowledge graph for music albums. Many times, the complete
  information about an album is not available from a single source,
  and it must be created by combining data from multiple sources.
  Frequently, new sources need to be added to get a complete picture
  of an album, and these sources, themselves, change over a period of
  time.  We need to keep the knowledge graph in sync with these
  changing sources.</p>

<p>As an example of changes that impact inference, consider the
constraint that a movie theater shows only movies. A knowledge graph
may infer that any program that is being shown in a movie theater is a
movie. But, more recently, sporting events, and sometimes, operas are
shown in a movie theater.  Based on the constraint that a movie
theater shows only movies, the inference algorithm will incorrectly
conclude that a sporting event or an opera is also a movie.  Fixing
this requires updating the relevant inference rules that draw these
conclusions.</p>

<p>As an example of a change requiring redesign, consider the
  situation where a knowledge graph initially represents
  the <i>CEO</i> of a company as a relation that has a <i>Person</i>
  as a value.  The designers may choose to redesign this representation
  so that the value of the <i>CEO</i> relation is another object with
  properties such as the time period for which that person held that
  position.</p>



<h3>3. Schema Evolution Techniques</h3>

<p>Schema evolution for a relational database is referred to as
database reogranization, and addresses problems that arise when
adding/removing a column.  Schema evolution for a knowledge graph is
more complex, and has operations such as adding/removing a class from
the class hierarchy, adding/removing a superclass to an existing
class, adding/removing type of an individual, adding/removing a
relation or a property from a class.  The additional complexity arises
because the class hierarchy needs to satisfy some constraints, and
some of the information inherits and propagates through the knowledge
graph.  We will next discuss some of these intricacies in greater
detail.</p>

<p>When we remove or rename a property, this change must be propagated throughout the
  knowledge graph. It is typical to generate a summary of all affected places where
  such an update will impact the knowledge graph. </p>

<p>When we add a new class to the class hierarchy without specifying
  its immediate superclass, we can assume it to be the class of a
  system-defined root class. This assumption is based on the
  constraint that we will not like to have orphan classes in the class
  hierarchy.</p>

<p>When we delete a class from the class hierarchy, or remove the
  superclass of a class, we need to make decisions about what to do
  about its subclasses, and its instances.  If its subclasses have
  another superclass, this does not pose a problem. But, if the class
  being deleted is the only superclass of a class, we need to either
  delete all the subclasses, and their instances or we need to assign
  a new superclass. To assign a new superclass to class <i>A</i> whose
  only superclass <i>B</i> is being deleted, the new superclass could
  be one or all immediate superclasses of <i>B</i>.  Furthermore, if
  there was any property associated with the class that is being
  deleted, we need to either delete those properties from all the
  classes and instances where it was inherited, or ensure that the
  property is associated with another class that will remain in the
  knowledge graph after the deletion of the class for which this property
  was originally defined.</p>

<p>Some updates to a class hierarchy can create subtle
  situations. Consider a situation in which <i>A</i> is a superclass
  of <i>B</i>, and <i>B</i> is a superclass of <i>C</i>.  Suppose we
  assert <i>A</i> to be a direct superclass of <i>C</i>. As this
  relationship can also be inferred through transitivity, should such
  an update even be allowed?  Many knowledge graph systems will reject
  such an update to the class hierarchy.</p>

<p>When adding a new superclass relationship to a class hierarchy, we
  need to make sure that we maintain the acylicity in the class
  hierarchy. If adding a new class will create cycles, support should
  be provided to detect and address the source of the problem.</p>

<p>When we change the constraint on a relation, we can run into at
  least two different situations. If we are relaxing the constraint,
  then it does not affect the existing data. But if we make the
  constraint on a relation tighter, it may invalidate some existing
  data, and suitable repair actions will be required.</p>

<h3>4. View Maintenance Techniques</h3>

<p>Views are a mechanism in relational database management systems to
name a query so that it can be executed simply by referencing the
name. The query is defined with respect to a set of one or more
tables, referred to as the <i>base</i> tables. If we choose to store the
results of the query corresponding to a view, it is referred to as
a <i>materialized</i> view. If a view is materialized, and there is a
change to data in the base tables, the view must be updated. Even
though the simplest approach is to recompute the view from scratch,
several efficient algorithms, known as <i>incremental</i> view
maintenance algorithms are available that do not compute the view from
scratch.</p>

<p>In the context of knowledge graphs, the use of view computation and
  maintenance techniques is currently not very common.  There are
  situations where data in the knowledge graph is processed, and the
  results are stored.  For such situations, view definition and
  maintenance techniques are directly applicable. Leveraging view
  update methods for such situations is open for future work.</p>

<h3>5. Truth Maintenance Techniques</h3>

<p>Truth maintenance techniques were originally developed in the
  context of rule-based systems to keep track of the derived conclusions
  which can be updated in response to any changes in data or
rules. A popular implementation of a truth maintenance system is known
as a justification system. In a justification-based system, every time
a new piece of information is derived, the system records a
justification for the derivation. The justification often includes
other facts, and rules that were used during the derivation. At a
future time, whenever there is a change in a fact or a rule, one can
examine various derivations where that fact or rule appears, and
update those derivations by taking the new information into
account.</p>


<p>In the context of knowledge graphs, the inferences are usually
  derived by the application code. In the current state of knowledge
  graph practice, the derived inferences are not explicitly tracked.
  As the modern graph engines mature, we anticipate there to be need
  for explicitly tracking the source of an inference to enable
  efficient update mechanisms.
</p>


<h3>6. Summary</h3>

<p>Knowledge graphs are created in response to specific business
needs, and have a life cycle. Many knowledge graphs persist over a
long period of times, and must evolve in response to the changes in
the real-world, and the changes in the business requirements. The
evolution of a knowledge graph needs to be sensitive to its usage by
the user community, needs to follow well-defined engineering
processes, and can benefit by using design principles and
algorithms. The design principles and algorithms can leverage from the
past work on schema evolution, view maintenance, and truth maintenance
system which will be increasingly important in the future generation
of knowledge graph system.</p>
