"Knowledge graphs: Introduction, history, and perspectives",31-Mar-22,"Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a compelling abstraction for organizing the world's structured knowledge and for integrating information extracted from multiple data sources. They are also beginning to play a central role in representing information extracted by AI systems, and for improving the predictions of AI systems by giving them knowledge expressed in KGs as input. The goals of this article are to (a) introduce KGs and discuss important areas of application that have gained recent prominence; (b) situate KGs in the context of the prior work in AI; and (c) present a few contrasting perspectives that help in better understanding KGs in relation to related technologies.",AI Magazine,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aaai.12033

Computable Contracts in the Financial Services Industry,3-Jan-22,"A computable contract is a contract that a computer can read, understand and execute. The financial services industry makes extensive use of contracts, for example, mortgage agreements, derivatives contracts, arbitration agreements, etc. Most of these contracts exist as text documents, making it difficult to automatically query, execute and analyze them. In this vision paper, we argue that the use of computable contracts in the financial services industry will lead to substantial improvements in customer experience, reductions in the cost of doing legal transactions, make it easier to respond to changing laws, and provide a much better framework for making decisions impacted by contracts. Using a simple payment agreement, we illustrate a Contract Definition Language, sketch several use cases and discuss their benefits to the financial services industry.",ARXIV,https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04685
A Case Study on Bootstrapping Ontology Graphs from Textbooks,31-Aug-21,"Ontology graphs are graphs in which the nodes are generic classes and edges have labels that specify the relationships between the classes.  In this paper, we address the question:to what extent can automated extraction and crowdsourcing techniques be combined to boostrap  the  creation  of  comprehensive  and  accurate  ontology  knowledge  graphs?   By adapting  the  state-of-the-art  language  model  BERT  to  the  task,  and  leveraging  a  novel relationship selection task, we show that even though it is difficult to achieve a high precision and recall, automated term extraction and crowd sourcing provide a way to bootstrap the ontology graph creation for further refinement and improvement through human effort.",Automated Knowledge Base Construction Conference,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=nDe2D8DDXKR

English Generation from a Knowledge Base and Overly General Classes,1-Sep-15,"In this paper, we describe the range of sentences that we synthesize from a knowledge base (KB) using a natural language generation (NLG) system. We give an overview of our NLG system, and then focus on the specific challenge in handling overly general classes such as Tangible-Entity and Physical-Object. Such classes are unavoidable in the KB, and it is undesirable to show them in an output for end users. Our approach has been implemented in an intelligent text-book application that helps students learn better.",Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence,https://aaai.org/papers/156-flairs-2015-10457/
Representing States in a Biology Textbook,1-Apr-15,"Representing biology textbook knowledge involves handling numerous concepts that have multiple possible states, for example, developmental states such as embryo, juvenile and larva; system states such as homeostasis and equilibrium; states of chromosomes such as chromatin, nicked, etc. Though substantial research exists on formalisms for representing states, relatively less work exists on ontologically representing them in a complex domain. Our findings include: (a) the word state in natural language is used with both entities and events which requires that we generalize the traditional definition of state to distinguish between an entity state and an event state; (b) an abstract modeling pattern called the process flow diagram that provides a practically achievable target for the output of natural language processing programs, and enables knowledge authoring by domain experts that can be compiled into a well-known background theory based on action languages. The background theory, combined with reasoning methods from the action language, allows building tools that simulate processes and answer sophisticated questions about process interruptions.",2015 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence Spring Symposium Series,https://cdn.aaai.org/ocs/10328/10328-45257-1-PB.pdf
Reasoning about Interruption of Biological Processes,1-Apr-15,"Humans are able to apply abstract reasoning patterns to learned knowledge and principles, and infer correct results. Our work is motivated by the vision of automated asking and answering of questions related to a biology textbook—a capability which requires application of abstract reasoning patterns. For example, biological processes such as cellular respiration have an intricate structure that defines the ordering among different steps and the participants in each step. A person who understands the process is expected to be able to reason with how the process is affected if one or more steps are interrupted. In this article we analyze a family of questions about process interruption, and present reasoning patterns that an automated reasoning system can use to answer them. Our reasoning patterns rely on the order of steps of the process and the participants of those steps. We suggest that this approach leads to more intuitive and simpler reasoning than an approach of based on theory of intentions, or an approach that relies on qualitative simulation. Our work is a step toward a system that can discuss answers to questions and assist human learners of biology.",Journal of Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212683X15000134

"Achieving Intelligence through Protyptes, Analogy and Composition",1-Jan-15,"In this paper, I summarize the results of a decade-plus of research and development driven by the vision that human knowledge can be grounded in a small number of prototypical components that can be extended through composition and analogy. These ideas have been embodied in a system called AURA, which has been used to engineer an expressive knowledge base for an intelligent biology textbook. The focus of the current paper is to abstract away from the specifics and, to instead describe the core ideas in such a manner that they can be transferred and applied in different contexts, and to relate those ideas to the ongoing research by others.","A,merican Association for Artificial Intelligence",https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/9769

Representing Roles in a Biology Textbook,21-Sep-14,"A biology textbook contains sentences such as “role of cytoskeleton is support and motility of a cell” and “NADH is an electron carrier that transfers electrons”. The first sentence explicitly uses the word role while in the second sentence the role of electron carrier is implicit. Role concepts have been defined in the context of upper ontologies for some time, but the word role has also been used in linguistics and description logics to denote related but different notions. In this paper, we consider the roles in a biology textbook, adapt a definition of roles based on upper ontologies, and relate it to the corresponding notions in linguistics and description logics. We consider our solutions to several conceptual modeling problems for roles as we have used them in representing the knowledge contained in a biology textbook. The primary contribution of this work is in applying the representation of roles to a complex and challenging domain, in giving definitions that can be applied by biologists, and in collecting several concrete examples that require such representation",2014 Workshop on Ontologies in Conceptual Modeling and Information Systems Engineering,https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1301/ontocomodise2014_4.pdf
Modeling of Continuity and Change in Biology,21-Sep-14,"Continuity and change is a core theme in biology that refers to how genetic information is carried forward. This paper reports on our initial steps toward representing this core theme and describes the methodological background and open challenges. We define continuity and change from a conceptual modeling perspective, identify its facets that require further ontological work, and present competency questions designed to check the adequacy of its representation. Moreover, we explore whether continuity and change must be explicitly represented as primitives in the representation of biological processes or whether it can be inferred from the process structure.",2014 Workshop on Ontologies in Conceptual Modeling and Information Systems Engineering,https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1301/ontocomodise2014_3.pdf

Inquire Biology: A Textbook that Answers Questions,1-Sep-13,"Inquire Biology is a prototype of a new kind of intelligent textbook — one that answers students’ questions, engages their interest, and improves their understanding. Inquire Biology provides unique capabilities through a knowledge representation that captures conceptual knowledge from the textbook and uses inference procedures to answer students’ questions. Students ask questions by typing free-form natural language queries or by selecting passages of text. The system then attempts to answer the question and also generates suggested questions related to the query or selection. The questions supported by the system were chosen to be educationally useful, for example: what is the structure of X? compare X and Y? how does X relate to Y? In user studies, students found this question-answering capability to be extremely useful while reading and while doing problem solving. In an initial controlled experiment, community college students using the Inquire Biology prototype outperformed students using either a hard copy or conventional ebook version of the same biology textbook. While additional research is needed to fully develop Inquire Biology, the initial prototype clearly demonstrates the promise of applying knowledge representation and question-answering technology to electronic textbooks.",AI Magazine,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1609/aimag.v34i3.2486

Object-Oriented Knowledge Bases in Logic Programming,1-Jul-13,"It is well-known that Description Logics (DLs) that admit efficient decision procedures are unable to rep- resent structured objects, i.e., objects whose parts are inter-connected in arbitrary instead of tree-like ways. A common solution to this problem is to extend a DL with a rule-based formalism. This either results in undecidability or requires restrictions on the shape of the rules, which typically prevent the rules from representing the required structures. In this paper, we consider an approach for modeling graph-structured objects using answer set programming. While in its full generality, reasoning with this representation is also undecidable, we consider a restriction which allows the representation of graph structured objects and yet the reasoning is decidable. We illustrate how this representation has been useful in exporting a biology knowledge base developed as part of Project Halo.",,https://static.cambridge.org/content/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:article:S1471068413000112/resource/name/tlp2013022.pdf

Project Halo Update — Progress Toward Digital Aristotle,1-Sep-10,"In the winter 2004 issue of AI Magazine, we reported Vulcan Inc.’s first step toward creating a question-answering system called Digital Aristotle.

This article reports the next step toward realizing a Digital Aristotle: we present the design and evaluation results for a system called AURA, which enables domain experts in physics, chemistry, and biology to author a knowledge base and that then allows a different set of users to ask novel questions against that knowledge base. These results represent a substantial advance over what we reported in 2004, both in the breadth of covered subjects and in the provision of sophisticated technologies in knowledge representation and reasoning, natural language processing, and question answering to domain experts and novice users.",AI Magazine,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1609/aimag.v31i3.2302

Design and Implementation of the CALO Query Manager,1-Jan-06,We report on our experience in developing a query-answering system that integrates multiple knowledge sources. The system is based on a novel architecture for combining knowledge sources in which the sources can produce new sub-goals as well as ground facts in the search for answers to existing sub-goals. The system uses a query planner that takes into account different query-processing capabilities of individual sources and augments them gracefully. A reusable ontology provides a mediated schema that serves as the basis for integration. We have evaluated the system on a suite of test queries in a realistic application to verify the practicality of our approach.,Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence,https://cdn.aaai.org/AAAI/2006/AAAI06-291.pdf

Vulcan envisions two primary roles for Digital Aristotle: as a tutor to instruct students in the sciences and as an interdisciplinary research assistant to help scientists in their work. As a first step towards this goal, we have just completed a six-month pilot phase designed to assess the state of the art in applied knowledge representation and reasoning (KR&R). Vulcan selected three teams, each of which was to formally represent 70 pages from the advanced placement (AP) chemistry syllabus and deliver knowledge-based systems capable of answering questions on that syllabus. The evaluation quantified each system’s coverage of the syllabus in terms of its ability to answer novel, previously unseen questions and to provide human-readable answer justifications.

Knowledge Entry as the Graphical Assembly of Components,1-Jan-03,"Despite some successes, the lack of tools to allow subject matter experts to directly enter, query, and debug formal domain knowledge in a knowledge-base still remains a major obstacle to their deployment. Our goal is to create such tools, so that a trained knowledge engineer is no longer required to mediate the interaction. This paper presents our work on the knowledge entry part of this overall knowledge capture task, which is based on several claims: that users can construct representations by connecting prefabricated, representational components, rather than writing low-level axioms; that these components can be presented to users as graphs; and the user can then perform composition through graph manipulation operations. To operationalize this, we have developed a novel technique of graphical dialog using examples of the component concepts, followed by an automated process for generalizing the user’s graphically-entered assertions into axioms. We present these claims, our approach, the system (called SHAKEN) that we are developing, and an evaluation of our progress based on having users encode knowledge using the system.",Knowledge Capture Conference,https://allenai.org/content/team/peterc/publications/kcap.pdf

Using Prior Knowledge: Problems and Solutions,1-Jan-00,"Encoding knowledge is time consuming and expensive. A possible solution to reduce the cost of developing a new knowledge base (KB) is to reuse existing knowledge. Previous work addressing this problem has focused on standards for representing, exchanging, and accessing knowledge (Genesereth and Fikes 1992), (Chaudhri et al. 1998), and on creating large repositories of knowledge (Lenat and Guha 1990). Results on the level of reuse achievable have been reported (Cohen et al. 1999). In this paper, we focus on the process of reuse and report a case study on constructing a KB by reusing existing knowledge. The reuse process involved the following steps: translation, comprehension, slicing, reformulation, and merging. We discuss technical problems encountered at each of these steps and explain how we solved them.",Association for Advancement of Artificial Intelligence,https://cdn.aaai.org/AAAI/2000/AAAI00-067.pdf
A Collaborative Environment for Authoring Large Knowledge Bases,1-Nov-99,"Collaborative knowledge base (KB) authoring environments are critical for the construction of high-performance KBs. Such environments must support rapid construction of KBs by a collaborative effort of teams of knowledge engineers through reuse of existing knowledge and software components. They should support the manipulation of knowledge by diverse problem-solving engines even if that knowledge is encoded in different languages and by different researchers. They should support large KBs and provide a scalable and interoperable development infrastructure. In this paper, we present an environment that satisfies many of these goals.  We present an architecture for scalable frame representation systems (FRSs). The Generic Frame Protocol (GFP) provides infrastructure for reuse of software components. It is a procedural interface to frame representation systems that provides a common means of accessing and modifying frame KBs. The Generic KB Editor (GKB-EDITOR) provides graphical KB browsing, editing, and comprehension services for large KBs. Scalability of loading and saving time is provided by a storage system (PERK) which submerges a database management system in an FRS. Multi-user access is controlled through a collaboration subsystem that uses a novel optimistic concurrency control algorithm. All the results have been implemented and tested in the development of several real KBs.",Journal of Intelligent Information Systems,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008763932600

OKBC: A Programmatic Foundation for Knowledge Base Interoperability,1-Jan-98,"The technology for building large knowledge bases (KBs) is yet to witness a breakthrough so that a KB can be constructed by the assembly of prefabricated knowledge components. Knowledge components include both pieces of domain knowledge (for example, theories of economics or fault diagnosis) and KB tools (for example, editors and theorem provers). Most of the current KB development tools can only manipulate knowledge residing in the knowledge representation system (KRS) for which the tools were originally developed. Open Knowledge Base Connectivity (OKBC) is an application programming interface for accessing KRSs, and was developed to enable the construction of reusable KB tools. OKBC improves upon its predecessor, the Generic Frame Protocol (GFP), in several significant ways. OKBC can be used with a much larger range of systems because its knowledge model supports an assertional view of a KRS. OKBC provides an explicit treatment of entities that are not frames, and it has a much better way of controlling inference and specifying default values. OKBC can be used on practically any platform because it sup- ports network transparency and has implementations for multiple programming languages. In this paper, we discuss technical design issues faced in the development of OKBC, highlight how OKBC improves upon GFP, and report on practical experiences in using it.",Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence,https://aaai.org/papers/00600-aaai98-085-okbc-a-programmatic-foundation-for-knowledge-base-interoperability/
Building Knowledge Base Management Systems,18-Sep-95,"Advanced applications in fields such as CAD, software engineering, real-time process control, corporate repositories and digital libraries require the construction, efficient access and management of large, shared knowledge bases. Such knowledge bases cannot be built using existing tools such as expert system shells, because these do not scale up, nor can they be built in terms of existing database technology, because such technology does not support the rich representational structure and inference mechanisms required for knowledge-based systems. This paper proposes a generic architecture for a knowledge base management system intended for such applications. The architecture assumes an object-oriented knowledge representation language with an assertional sublanguage used to express constraints and rules. It also provides for general-purpose deductive inference and special-purpose temporal reasoning. Results reported in the paper address several knowledge base management issues. For storage management, a new method is proposed for generating a logical schema for a given knowledge base. Query processing algorithms are offered for semantic and physical query optimization, along with an enhanced cost model for query cost estimation. On concurrency control, the paper describes a novel concurrency control policy which takes advantage of knowledge base structure and is shown to outperform two-phase locking for highly structured knowledge bases and update-intensive transactions. Finally, algorithms for compilation and efficient processing of constraints and rules during knowledge base operations are described. The paper describes original results, including novel data structures and algorithms, as well as preliminary performance evaluation data. Based on these results, we conclude that knowledge base management systems which can accommodate large knowledge bases are feasible.",VLDB Journal,https://www.vldb.org/journal/VLDBJ5/60050238.pdf
